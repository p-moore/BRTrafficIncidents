The project members are Preston Moore, Vikram Malarkannan, and Wasim Alam. To run our project, we used the newest version of PyCharm (as of 12/5/2019). The code will run as long as our dataset is within the project folder. Once the code runs, a few visualizations will pop up displaying some of the relevant data we found. Also, some data will pop up on the console that doesn’t show up in the figures themselves. For one of the figures, the x-axis doesn’t display the full time data, so we put it in a print statement to help the user understand what is being shown by the figure.
Some packages imported and used were: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn. The data for our dataframe can be found at: https://data.brla.gov/Transportation-and-Infrastructure/Baton-Rouge-Traffic-Incidents/2tu5-7kif
